## Overview

**Swiftlet Utilities** provides several useful functions that are common across many apps written in SwiftUI and Xcode. These include features such as testing to see if an app can connect to the internet, etc.

Additionally, many built-in types (such as `Color`, `String` and `Data`) have been extended with useful features such as converting a color to and from a hex string and moving images easily between `Data` and `String` types to support Swift's `Codable` protocol.

**Swiftlet Utilities** are support on iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS.
